=== BUILDING FFMPEG ON WINDOWS ===
Revised 2.24.2017

This version supersedes the earlier version: Compile FFmpeg for Windows.txt 

Note:
1. FFMPEG is constantly evolving. Usually, the latest major release is what we would need for integration.
2. It may be possible to build FFMPEG using the latest version of Visual Studio (currently, VS2015) but FFMPEG build documentation is a few VS versions behind (VS2012 at this time). This document describes build process using MinGW tools.
3. See FFmpeg Compilation Guide, https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide, for hints and changes in build process.
4. This document does not cover building x265 encoder which is currently not needed.

1. Install MSYS2
	MSYS2 is a much improved development environment based on MingW-w64 and Cygwin.

	a. Download the latest Windows installer from http://www.msys2.org/, for a 64-bit Windows system you'll need installer with the name staring with "msys2-x86_64...".
	b. Launch MSYS2 terminal window: search for "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit"
	c. Configure the package manager:
		-- on the MinGW command line enter (enter capital "Y" when prompted to confirm):

				pacman -S make
				pacman -S diffutils
				pacman -S yasm
				pacman -S tar
				pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
				pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc		

2. Download FFMPEG source
	a. Download the latest stable release from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#releases, choose gzip tarball format.
	b. Copy gzip file to a suitable location, say, C:\git-repos\qda\2rdparty\ffmpeg-gopro-win\ffmpeg if you are planning to add the build to the desktop repo.
	c. From the bash prompt cd to /c/git-repos/qda_new/3rdparty/ffmpeg-gopro-win/ffmpeg and say tar -xvf 
	d. Verify that ffmpeg source tree has been extracted to C:\git-repos\qda_new\3rdparty\ffmpeg-gopro-win\ffmpeg\ffmpeg-3.2.4 (assuming the current FFMPEG version is 3.2.4).
						
3. Configure and run FFMPEG build
	a. From the bash prompt cd to ffmpeg-3.2.4.
	b. Enter: ./configure --disable-static --disable-network --disable-debug --enable-shared --enable-avresample
	   Note: this step should complete without any problems but if configure returns an error, you may need to inspect config.log (in the ffmpeg-3.2.4 directory)
	c. Enter make.
	d. Wait...

4. Collect the DLL's
	Look for the newly built DLL's and corresponding static libraries, e.g. by running a search for *.dll and *.lib files in ffmpeg-3.2.4 directory and copy them to the ffmpeg-3.2.4\bin directory.
