	1.	Install MinGW from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
		a. Must make fstab file in c:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc to set environment path
		b. Copy fstab.sample and remove Perl include line and .sample extension
		c. Once path is set gcc command will work
	2. Run minsys.bat from C:\MinGW\msys\1.0 to start MinGW32 Shell
		a. Type 'cd c:/contribwin/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-1.2.3 2013-08-27'
		b. Type 'configure --disable-network --disable-debug --disable-yasm --enable-shared'
			i. --disable-network avoids dependency on winsocket
			ii. --disable-debug for lean libraries
			iii. --disable-yasm because YASM (Assembly Compiler) is not installed
			iv. --enable-shared allows the creation of the dlls
		c. Type 'make' to start the build
			i. Takes approximately 10-15 minutes to build all dlls
			ii. Built Dlls are located in there respective folders
				1) Example: 'swscale-2.dll' is in 'c:/contribwin/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-1.2.3 2013-08-27/libswscale' directory
